    <!--This is paragraph tag -->
    <!-- for italisize the text we can use both <i></i> tag as well as <em></em> tag but
         we will always use em tag because it tells the brower to emphasize that word or text
         rather than giving it a style which the i tag tells to the browser  -->
    <!-- same goes for <b></b> tag and <strong></strong> tag use strong tag over b tag because
         strong tag tells the browser that the specific text has a strong importance     -->
